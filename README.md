# the-GArdian
React Native demo app powered by The Gardian API

##note
This repo won't work unless you get an access key to The Guardian API. Once you get yourself an API key, go to ```./utils/core.js``` to the line 7 and set the variable ``apiKey`` with your Api key. You can get your key in this link [Get The Guardian API key](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/#get-access)
